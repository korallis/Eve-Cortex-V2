# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The EVE Online Optimizer is a comprehensive web platform that leverages the EVE Online ESI API to collect all available data (public and private scopes) and provides AI-powered optimization recommendations to give players a competitive edge. The platform focuses on ship fitting optimization, career path guidance, and strategic recommendations across all aspects of EVE Online gameplay including missions, exploration, mining, PvP, planetary interaction, and ISK generation strategies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an EVE Online player, I want to connect my character data through ESI API authentication, so that I can receive personalized recommendations based on my actual skills, assets, and game state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN authentication is complete THEN the system SHALL store and regularly refresh the user's access tokens
4. WHEN user data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL fetch character skills, assets, wallet, market data, and all available character information
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the system to automatically analyze my character and proactively recommend the most optimal ship fittings based on my specific skills, implants, and career goals, so that I achieve maximum effectiveness without having to manually evaluate options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes my character THEN it SHALL automatically calculate and recommend the highest-performing fits for my skill set
2. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL factor in all character-specific modifiers from implants, boosters, and skill levels
3. WHEN a player has Frigate V THEN the system SHALL apply the 5% per level bonus to hybrid turret damage and recommend fits that maximize this advantage
4. WHEN calculating optimal fits THEN the system SHALL use EVE's Dogma system data for precise attribute calculations
5. WHEN presenting recommendations THEN the system SHALL rank fits by effectiveness and explain why each is optimal for the character
6. WHEN displaying fits THEN the system SHALL show projected performance metrics with character-specific bonuses applied
7. IF a player lacks skills for the optimal fit THEN the system SHALL recommend the best alternative AND suggest skill training priorities to achieve the optimal setup

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to specify my career focus (missions, exploration, mining, PvP, etc.), so that I receive tailored ship recommendations and strategic advice for my chosen gameplay style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a career path THEN the system SHALL filter recommendations to match that specialization
2. WHEN "Missions" is selected THEN the system SHALL provide faction and corporation mission options with level recommendations
3. WHEN "PvP" is selected THEN the system SHALL recommend fits optimized for player combat scenarios
4. WHEN "Mining" is selected THEN the system SHALL optimize for yield, tank, and efficiency
5. WHEN "Exploration" is selected THEN the system SHALL focus on scanning, hacking, and survivability fits
6. WHEN multiple career paths are selected THEN the system SHALL provide hybrid recommendations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mission runner, I want detailed information about mission factions, corporations, enemy types, and damage profiles, so that I can choose optimal fits and strategies for specific mission types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing mission options THEN the system SHALL list all available factions and corporations
2. WHEN selecting a faction THEN the system SHALL display mission levels, enemy types, and damage profiles
3. WHEN enemy damage types are shown THEN the system SHALL recommend appropriate resistance profiles
4. WHEN mission difficulty is displayed THEN the system SHALL suggest minimum ship classes and fitting requirements
5. WHEN comparing missions THEN the system SHALL show ISK/hour potential and risk assessments

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a competitive player, I want multiple fitting options for each scenario rather than just one recommendation, so that I can choose the approach that best matches my playstyle and risk tolerance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting ship recommendations THEN the system SHALL provide at least 3 different fitting approaches
2. WHEN displaying multiple fits THEN the system SHALL categorize them by focus (DPS, Tank, Speed, Cost-effectiveness)
3. WHEN showing alternatives THEN the system SHALL explain the trade-offs and use cases for each option
4. WHEN budget constraints exist THEN the system SHALL provide budget-friendly alternatives
5. WHEN advanced fits are shown THEN the system SHALL include expensive/optimal variants

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player seeking comprehensive optimization, I want AI-powered recommendations for planetary interaction, market opportunities, and ISK generation strategies, so that I can maximize my overall game efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing economic tools THEN the system SHALL analyze current market data for profit opportunities
2. WHEN planetary interaction is selected THEN the system SHALL recommend optimal planet setups based on character skills

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a career path THEN the system SHALL generate a prioritized skill training plan optimized for that specialization
2. WHEN I specify a target ship THEN the system SHALL create a skill plan that enables optimal fitting and piloting of that ship
3. WHEN generating skill plans THEN the system SHALL consider my current skills and calculate the most efficient training order
